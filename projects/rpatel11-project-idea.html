    <p> <h4> For my project, I would like to make a few pages about sharks and present on the different species of sharks</h4></p>
    <p><h3> I have a vast knowledge of sharks and I think I can produce a lot of content and use HTML and CSS to display these facts and photos </h3> </p> 
    <p> <h3> For example, Great White Sharks, or <abbr title="Great White Sharks">GWS</abbr> are the most commonly known type of shark, and I would like to discuss different types </h3> </p>
